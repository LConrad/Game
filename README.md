# Game
I'm going to make a simple 'War' game. It's not global, or thermo-nuclear. 

Clone my repo (into a folder called Game, for example)
compile using javac (cd into .../Game/src/avengers and run javac AvengersAssemble.java)
run using java (cd into .../Game/src and run java avengers/AvengersAssemble)
You can give command-line names if you don't want to use the default Avengers list (i.e. java avengers/AvengersAssemble Steve Mark Lauren).
